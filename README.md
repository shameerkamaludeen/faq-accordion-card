## Overview

This challenge is so far the most difficult challenge on my learning period of front-end from Frontend Mentor. The challenge mostly faced on placing the elements in a particular location on the exact position as design suggest as well as the design seems developed not based on the ability to achieve using HTML and CSS or made over-complicated things or its completely my perspective as I am just started learning front-end.  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Started familiarising myself the JavaScript as I used some in this challenge.
- Came to know that transition on an element with some properties are not possible and how to tackle to achieve the same with the help of other properties.
- The accessibility is more important than any design and how difficult it may do not guard down the accessibility for the design.

### Continued development

- Better improvement in transition and animation
- Better imprevement in the javascript

### Useful resources

- [A replacement for the transition on display or visibility property](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3508605/3877538) - This helped me achieve transition on the problem faced while trying to transition using display or visibility property.
- [Center an absolutely positioned element in a div](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1776915/3877538)
